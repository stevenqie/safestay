## Project Summary

There are a multitude of factors that are taken into consideration when searching for an apartment which can be hard to manage. To assist future Champaign residents with their current apartment search, our application provides a map visualization that includes all apartment buildings in Champaign Illinois that are tagged with 2 scores: an overall ‘SafeStay’ score which is calculated using three different datasets (number of street lights and police stations within the vicinity of the building and the amount of pedestrian crashes), and a community generated safe score where viewers are able to create their own account on the SafeStay app and contribute by adding their own safety rating for buildings, which helps refine the community-generated score. Alongside this, we include filtering to refine the search for apartments above a certain SafetyScore.
